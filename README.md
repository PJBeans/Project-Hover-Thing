# Project-Hover-Thing
Build this game in Unity.

This (currently unnamed) project is simple; press "w" (will be remapped to the touchscreen when ported to Android) to make your cube fly. You must reach the red landing point to progress to the next level. To move around the map, you must bump into objects that will change your angle. It's a little hard to explain, so how about you take it for a spin and see for your self!

## Committing to this repository

- 1. Only one control, and that is the control to fly. Pull Requests changing this will not be merged.
- 2. Keep the textures simple.

## End Platforms
This game will be designed for Android.
- A Windows/Mac/Linux port will be available but will not be the target for the app; it won't be optimized for mouse/keyboard.
-iOS will **not** be supported

## Will you support my platform in the future?

I don't know why you really care considering I'm not a big developer, but here's the deal:
- As for as iOS goes, Apple requires developers $99 a year for a dev account. I do not use iOS or even own an iOS device, or a Mac, so testing for the application would be quite hard (Idk if I'd need to own a Mac if I'm using Unity, but I still don't have an iOS device). I'm sorry to say it, but I just don't really care about developing for iOS in the first place. If you _really_ want this game on iOS, build it yourself and run it :D. If you have an Apple Dev Account, you can upload it to the App Store as long as you keep the game without ads, keep it 100% free, credit me and credit the source. You would upload it in YOUR name (E.g., "Project Hover Thing; By Johnny Appleseed", not "Project Hover Thing; By PJBeans") and make any modifications you would feel neccessary to enhance the game on iOS, and perhaps add a splash for your username.
- I may add the app to the Windows Store for Windows Phone/Tablet users, but this would mean Windows PC users could have the game as well. However, it will still be optimized for touch, but the "w" key will still be mapped.
- I don't see much point for developing for consoles, but Xbox One may be supported if the app is added to the Windows store.

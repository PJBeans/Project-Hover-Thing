# The-Cube-Trials
Build this game in Unity.

## NOTE: I won't be developing for this project for a little while. Despite what the end-of-game message declares, do not expect this to be on the Google Play Store anytime soon.

^ The reason for this is that I feel the game is just to tedious rather than fun. If I (or you, it's open-sourced ;) ) have better ideas for level design, I'll push them to the repository (or you'll create a pull request).

"The Cube Trials" project is simple; tap the screen (or press "w") to make your cube fly. You must reach the red landing point to progress to the next level. To move around the map, you must bump into objects that will change your angle. It's a little hard to explain, so how about you take it for a spin and see for your self!

## Committing to this repository

- 1. Only one control, and that is the control to fly. Pull Requests changing this will not be merged.
- 2. Keep the textures simple.

## End Platforms
- **This game will be designed for Android.**
- A Windows/Mac/Linux port will be available but will not be the target for the app.

## Unsupported platforms
- an iOS build should still function correctly, but this app will not be coming to the App Store. See below.

## Will you support my platform in the future?

I don't know why you really care about supported platforms considering I'm not a big developer, but here's the deal:
- As far as iOS goes, Apple requires developers  to pay $99 a year for a dev account. I do not use iOS, own an iOS device, nor a Mac, so testing for the application would be quite difficult. I'm sorry to say it, but I just don't really care about developing for iOS in the first place. If you _really_ want this game on iOS, build it yourself and run it. If you have an Apple Dev Account, you can upload it to the App Store as long as you keep the game without ads, keep it 100% free, credit me and credit the source. You would upload it in YOUR name (E.g., "Project Hover Thing; By Johnny Appleseed", not "Project Hover Thing; By PJBeans") and make any modifications you would feel neccessary to enhance the game on iOS, and perhaps add a splash for your username. **Contact me prior to doing this.**

- I may add the app to the Windows Store for Windows Phone/Tablet users, thus this would mean Windows PC users could install the game as well. While the game will still be optimized for touch, but the "w" key will still be mapped.
